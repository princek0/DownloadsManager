# DownloadsManager
- A program that sorts your downloads folder into 6 subfolders: Images, Videos, Texts, Special, Other, Office365.
- This program probably won't work on any other OS other than Windows. Admittedly, I don't know much about how other OS work so it might still be a viable option.
- The file extension is .pyw so that terminal does not need to run for the program itself to run but if you want to change this then just rename the file extension to .py .
- If you execute the program once, it will keep executing every 10 minutes and will also add itself to your start-up folder so that when you close your PC it will open automatically.
- Your anti-malware might send a warning, if you don't trust the code then carefully read through each line!
