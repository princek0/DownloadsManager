# DownloadsManager
- A program that sorts your downloads folder into 6 subfolders: Images, Videos, Texts, Special, Other, Office365.
- The file extension is .pyw so that terminal does not need to run for the program itself to run but if you want to change this then just rename the file extension to .py .
- If you execute the program once, it will keep executing every 1 second and will also add itself to your start-up folder so that when you close your PC it will open automatically.
- Your anti-malware might send a warning, if you don't trust the code then carefully read through each line! 

<b>Libraries used:</b>
